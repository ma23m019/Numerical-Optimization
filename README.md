# Numerical Optimization Course Repository

Welcome to my Numerical Optimization Course Repository!

This repository contains the code and projects I've developed as part of my studies and exploration into numerical optimization techniques.

## About Numerical Optimization

Numerical optimization is a field of mathematical optimization that deals with finding the best solution to a given problem from a set of possible solutions. It is widely used in various fields such as machine learning, engineering, finance, and operations research, among others. Optimization algorithms aim to minimize or maximize an objective function while satisfying certain constraints.
