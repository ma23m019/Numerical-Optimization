# Numerical-Optimization

This repository is dedicated to providing implementations of various numerical optimization algorithms (in python) that I learnt during the course Numerical Optimization.

About Numerical Optimization:
Numerical optimization is a field of mathematical optimization that deals with finding the best solution to a given problem from a set of possible solutions. It is widely used in various fields such as machine learning, engineering, finance, and operations research, among others. Optimization algorithms aim to minimize or maximize an objective function while satisfying certain constraints.
